                <h4>UML Diagrams</h4>
                <p>The first lesson I learned from this course was the UML (Unified Modeling Language) class diagrams. It is quite a confusing topic, so my first UML diagram made almost no sense (Figure 1), thankfully I was able to do better in a follow-up assignment (Figure 2).<br><br>The first UML diagram entails a program that only had two classes: Works and Customer. However, since I didn't fully comprehend that an UML diagram should only have classes in it, I added additional items that shouldn't belong in an UML diagram. Learning from this, in the follow-up assignment, I removed all the unnecessary items and only included all the classes that existed in the program. This helped make the UML diagram look much cleaner and a lot easier to look at and comprehend.</p>

                <h4>Documentation: Classes, Functions, Objects</h4>
                <p>Another early lesson I received from this course would be how to document classes, functions, and objects. This is prominently shown in the Extending Data Structures assignment, as well as the team project (displayed on the right).<br><br>Figure 3 and 4 displays my documentation of classes, slightly different to how I document functions (Figure 6) and objects (Figure 5). The slight variation is naming all the methods/functions that exist and can be accessed in this class. On the other hand, object and functions only need to document for its parameters when necessary. The only similarity between all documentations would be helping the user get a grasp on what the class/object/function is about, which is the job of documentation. Of course, there are many ways to document classes/functions/objects and the examples on the right only demonstrates one of the possible ways to document them.</p>

                <h2>Recursion</h2>
                <p>Recursion is the idea of repeating something over and over again.<br>The code for this assignment is relatively short, when compared to the other programs I have written, and requires no user input, yet still told a plausible story: playing Hide-and-Seek. In this program that I have written, only one function is used since it is able to perform the task at hand by running itself recursively.</p>

                <h2>Classes and Objects</h2>
                <p>A class stores the objects. Class groups up the objects, and organizes them, allowing for easier access.<br>This is a major concept in this course, and I used objects and classes in most of the assignments assigned in this course. Classes and objects were present and used in the Data Structures assignment, the Extending Data Structures assignment, and, of course, the team project assignment.</p>

                <h2>Inheritance</h2>
                <p>Inheritance allows for classes (more than one) to use attributes/functions that already exist in another class without copying and pasting them.<br>Inheritance was used in the Extending Data Structures assignment, describing because the class ‘User’ is essentially the parent class of both class ‘Customer’ and class ‘Employee so ‘Customer’ and the ‘Employee’ can both use the attributes/functions that already exist in the class ‘User’.</p>

                <h2>File Reading and Writing</h2>
                <p>File reading and writing are necessary skills for this course, as all my ‘databases’ are just textfiles (Figure 3). In order to modify and grab information from these ‘databases’, file reading and writing are used (Figure 4). File reading and writing are present in the Data Structures assignment, Extending Data Structures assignment, and the team project.</p>

                <h2>Algorithms</h2>
                <p>Algorithms are essential to programming, especially for sorting and search items within the program. As suggested by their names, sorting algorithms will sort the items in the desired order, and searching algorithms will search for the item requested. Both of these algorithms are explored in the algorithms assignment.</p>
